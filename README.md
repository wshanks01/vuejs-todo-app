# vue-todo-app

> A simple Todo app using a Scotch.io tutorial. Tutorial was sparse and missing some info however that required a bit of debugging on my end which helped my understanding of Vue.js

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
